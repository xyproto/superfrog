Superfrog Menu System
=====================

This is an odd little program from 2007, for displaying a simple menu with Python and Pygame.

Supports Python 3.8 and beyond. Please report an issue if there are... issues.

The menu can be configured by editing `menu.txt`. It can launch executables on your system.
